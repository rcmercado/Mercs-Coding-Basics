The primary HTML page includes style.css, which sets the CSS rules for the HTML elements.  Ideally, there would be no inline CSS clogging up the structure of the HTML.  Classes should be defined for like elements, and IDs should be used for elements that are totally unique and seperate from all other elements.

.class1  { . . . }

#id  { . . . }

elementName { . . . }

.class1 nav { . . . }  // class that contains a nav element:   <div class="class1"><nav> . . . </nav></div>
